# Python-Social-Media-Bot
Hello Humans of the Internet!
I wanted to do 3 things.
1. Authomate my social media so I can use it more efficently and have the abillity to do cool stuff in the future
2. Learn Python
3. Learn GitHub

Now with this new bot I am working on I can now do all 3!

Currenlty this bot supports: Discord

~Some easy to answer questions~

Q: Why Python? 
A: I chose Python because there are a lot of APIs for it and I want this bot to be able to access as many Social Media programs as possible!

Q: Why are you putting this on GitHub
A: I am putting this bot on GitHub for the public because I havn't seen anyone else do this...

Q: Can I use your code?
A: Yeah feel free to use it but just make sure to credit me.
